# This is the CONFIGURATION FILE to set up your SERVER ADDRESS and public data area
#  ( conf/serverAddressAndPublicDiskSetup.sh )

# Fill the name convention of your:

# - server type (ftp, http ..)
# - server address 
# - public disk space name convention
#    (if the disk address is not the same as the html address sub-path)

# As given in below examples

# ----------------------------------------------

# PUBLIC DATA - FOR UCSC VISUALISATION

# All visualisation data will be saved in a publicly available disk space
# If PIPE_hubbing.txt is used - ALL FILES are saved directly in the publicly available disk space.
# If PIPE_hubbingSymbolic.txt is used, symbolic links are generated for the bigwig files instead of storing the actual files.
#     When using PIPE_hubbingSymbolic.txt , the folder given in column 3 in PIPE_hubbingSymbolic.txt (the folder from which
#     the bigwigs are linked to the public data area),
#     needs to be WORLD-READABLE (a=r)

# The HTTP (or ftp) server address, and public data folder structure

SERVERTYPE="http"
SERVERADDRESS="userweb.molbiol.ox.ac.uk"

# These together set the server address to be :
# http://userweb.molbiol.ox.ac.uk

# If you don't set the ones below, it assumes the public data area structure looks like this :

# Disk area location :
# /public/datafile.txt

# Publicly available file in server :
# http://userweb.molbiol.ox.ac.uk/public/datafile.txt

# You can delete or add stuff from the path, to match your data area design, with these parameters :

# /public/telenius/dnasepipetests/PORTtest291216b

REMOVEfromPUBLICFILEPATH=""

# For example, your disk area location is :
# /upper/folder/public/datafile.txt

# And your publicly available file in server :
# http://userweb.molbiol.ox.ac.uk/public/datafile.txt

# To reach that, you would need to set :
# REMOVEfromPUBLICFILEPATH="/upper/folder"

ADDtoPUBLICFILEPATH=""

# For example, your disk area location is :
# /public/datafile.txt

# Publicly available file in server :
# http://userweb.molbiol.ox.ac.uk/home/folder/public/datafile.txt

# To reach that, you would need to set :
# ADDtoPUBLICFILEPATH="/home/folder"

tobeREPLACEDinPUBLICFILEPATH=""
REPLACEwithThisInPUBLICFILEPATH="" # This can be empty : then the 'tobeREPLACEDinPUBLICFILEPATH' will be replaced with '' (just removed)

# For example, your disk area location is :
# /public/sub/folder/datafile.txt

# And your publicly available file in server :
# http://userweb.molbiol.ox.ac.uk/public/another/folder/structure/datafile.txt

# To reach that, you would need to set :
# tobeREPLACEDinPUBLICFILEPATH="/sub/folder"
# REPLACEwithThisInPUBLICFILEPATH="/another/folder/structure"


# THE ORDER THE ABOVE TAKE EFFECT :

# 1) REMOVE from public path
# 2) ADD to public path
# 3) REPLACE in public path

# Note !! - the (3) is vulnerable to repeating of the same subfolder structure.
# It only will find and replace the LEFTmost of the occurrences of the file path it searches for.

# You can finetune the subroutine parsePublicLocations() which does this parsing :
# it is given in the end of this config.sh file !
